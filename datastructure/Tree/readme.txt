properties of tree 
    1) node
    2) edge
    3) root node
    4) leaf node : node that do not have any child node
    5) siblings
    6) ancester node : parents parent node
    7) path : sequence of nodes and edges from node to another
    8) distance : edges of shortest path between two nodes
    9) degree of a node : is the total number of child nodes it has
    10) degree of a tree : is the maximum degree of a node in the tree
    11) depth of a node : is the number of edges from the root to that node
    12) height of a node : is the number of edges from the deepest leaf to that node
    13) height of the tree : height of the root node
    14) 
binary tree : each node has a maximum of two nodes

Binary tree properties:
    1) value of left node should be less than the parent node
    2) value of rigth node should be greater than the parent node 
    3) used to implement searching, sorting and abstract data structures such as look up tables and priority queues.
